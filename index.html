        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            As a high school student who is now going to college, I have learned that scheduling and making a to-do list, and accomplishing is crucial to finishing my work on time. However, planners and to-do list webpages/apps on market do not have every function I want and are uncomfortable to use. Therefore, I decided to design my own for myself and other students.
