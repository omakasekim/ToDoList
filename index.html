      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        As a high school student who is now going to college, I have learned
        that scheduling, making a to-do list, and accomplishing them is crucial
        to finishing my work on time.
        <br />
        However, planners and to-do list webpages/apps currently on the market
        do not have the functions I want and are uncomfortable to use.
        Therefore, I decided to design my own todo-list for myself and other
        students.
      </p>

      <a href="/page1.html">
        <h1>First Page : Monthly Calendar Page</h1>
      </a>
      <img style="width: 60%" src="/dump/page1.png" />
      <p>
        You can choose the desired month with the button above and fill in the
        boxes showing the date with events or work to do on that day.
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <a href="/page2.html">
        <h1>Second Page : To-do List Page</h1>
      </a>
      <img style="width: 60%" src="/dump/page2.png" />
      <p>
        Shows a clear and editable daily to-do list, that shows how many to do
        things you have planned for each day. This can either be shown as
        completed, imcompleted, and can be editted or deleted.
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <a href="/page3.html">
        <h1>Third Page : Timer Page</h1>
      </a>
      <img style="width: 60%" src="/dump/page3.png" />
      <p>
        You can choose what background image to show up. There is also a timer
        that you could set a certain time limit that you could use to study.
